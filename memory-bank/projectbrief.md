# Excel Clone Project Brief

## Overview
This is a React-based Excel clone built with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The application provides a spreadsheet interface with an Excel-like ribbon UI, grid functionality, and formula support.

## Core Requirements
- **Functional Ribbon Interface**: All ribbon buttons must work as real commands
- **Cell Operations**: Copy, paste, cut, formatting (font, colors, alignment, etc.)
- **Grid Management**: Cell selection, editing, formula evaluation
- **Excel-like UX**: Maintain familiar Excel interface patterns

## Current State
- Basic grid functionality working with cell selection and editing
- Formula engine implemented with basic operations
- Ribbon UI structure complete but buttons are non-functional
- Sheet management (tabs, navigation) working
- Formula building mode for cell references

## Technology Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui component library
- Custom formula engine

## Key Goals
1. Make all ribbon buttons functional
2. Implement cell formatting (fonts, colors, alignment, borders)
3. Add clipboard operations (copy, paste, cut)
4. Support text formatting (bold, italic, underline)
5. Add number formatting options
6. Implement cell styling and conditional formatting
